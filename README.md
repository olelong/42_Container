# Piscine_cpp  

A piscine to discover the c++ language.  
  
The pool is decomposed in 9 days of modules. We learn little by little the basics of C++.  
  
### How to make the exercises work:
Run the command ``` c++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98 ``` followed by all ``` *.cpp ```  
##### OR  
Run the ``` make ``` command if the folder contains a Makefile  
Then launch the executable ``` ./executable_name ``` + arguments if necessary according to the exercises.  

  
### Day00 :
We discover in this day the Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio, streams, initialization  
lists, static, const, and other basics...
